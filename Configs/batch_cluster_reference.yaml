# This is an example (reference) config file for setting up a batch cluster
# submission directories, submitting, and/or creating a submitting script.
#
# Set an input package/project that needs submissions' creation:
# ["Generic"]["projects_input_path"]
#
# Set project's config file that has a single submission maker script
# ["Generic"]["submission_maker"]
#

## Generic parameters
Generic:
    # Project's location/path. This is going to be set for a cluster run
    project_input_path: 'Inputs/examples/batch_cluster/'
    # Project's config file, has a common section (batch_cluster) for
    # interfacing! File should be placed in projects_input_path

    # A file were the the output will be directed (with extras WRT console)
    log_filename: 'batch_cluster.log'
    # Console verbosity: all, warnings, errors
    console_vebosity: 'all'


execution_specifics:
